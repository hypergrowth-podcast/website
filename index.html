      <h3 id = "what">What is the Hypergrowth podcast?</h3>
      <p>We’re two students devoted to learning as much as possible from high profile thought-leaders in an attempt to grow ourselves. While we value a university education, we believe that a lot of students are not adequately prepared with various prolific and nuanced perspectives that the university doesn’t explicitly teach. We call these perspectives mental models. 

      </p>
      <h3>What are Mental Models?</h3>
      <p>An explanation of someone's thought process about how something works in the real world.
       <br>
       <br>A simple example of a mental model is conformation bias which derives from Thucydides, an Ancient Greek historian.
       <br> This is a type of thinking where we as people tend to notice or find evidence that confirms what beliefs we already have, rather than evidence that contradicts our beliefs.
       This type of thinking is obviously very dangerous, but once you’re aware of this mental model - its something you can actively use to make sure you’re not falling into the confirmation bias trap. 
      <br><br>We believe that mental models are simply tools. Based on your life, some may be incredibly useful, while not so much - however, equipping yourself and understanding these thought frameworks
       will allow you to make better sense of the world.
      <br><br> 
      <strong>At Hypergrowth, we want to build a toolbox of these models -  from some of the greatest thinkers in the world. </strong>
      </p>
      <h3>Who we are.</h3>
      <p> Both of us serve as Venture Partners for the university-focused venture capital fund, and have interests that span healthcare, tech, law and business - we’re seriously interested in it all.
        </p>
